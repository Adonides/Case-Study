                        Nowadays before enrolling a college, online curse e  taught self, we got think what the best method to learn X or Z.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                          Is the traditional way the better option and what to say about online learning? In this article I will run over through those questions and give my sincere opinion about them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Traditional Education</h4>
                    <p>
                        For more I think about learning, less I become excited about traditional learning, if you ask me it is about to follow one pattern, a routine and most of the time to be forced to learning things you are not interesting and much worse, it will not be necessary for your career at all.  It is a very expense investment and require you to move around to be where the class will take over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The strongest defend to traditional learning would be the network, programs and internships offered from those institutes who has the power to partnership with companies. Oh yeah but those benefices are not for every alumnus, the most the time just few students are including to it. No really, the main aspect I would pick from the traditional education is the structure, I say it because there are some subjects, career we must use expense equipment, and the easiest example is to study medicine, I would say it is almost impossible to buy it to have a private laboratory. Even tough partial online curse would to the job!
